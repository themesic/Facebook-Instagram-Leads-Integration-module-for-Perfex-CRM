# 🎛️ Settings Page

The main settings page is your **command center** for managing the Facebook & Instagram Leads integration. Here's everything you can do! ⚙️

***

## 🔗 How to Access

Go to **Meta Leads** → **Settings** in the Perfex CRM sidebar.

Or navigate directly to: `https://yourcrm.com/admin/facebookleadsintegration`

***

## 📊 Statistics Dashboard

At the top, you'll see four stat boxes showing your **monthly** performance:

| Stat | What It Shows | Color |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🟢 **Synced This Month** | Successfully imported leads | Green |
| 🔴 **Failed This Month** | Leads that failed to import | Red |
| 🟡 **Pending Retry** | Leads waiting to be retried | Yellow |
| 🔵 **Total This Month** | All leads attempted | Blue |

***

## 🔌 Connection Status

Three indicators show if everything is connected:

| Indicator | What It Means |
| --- | --- |
| 🟢 **App Credentials — Configured** | Your App ID & Secret are saved |
| 🟢 **Webhook — Verified** | Facebook successfully verified your webhook |
| 🟢 **Access Token — Token Saved** | You've connected with Facebook and a token is stored |

> 🎯 **Goal:** All three should be green! 🟢🟢🟢

### Action Buttons

| Button | What It Does |
| --- | --- |
| 🔍 **Test Connection** | Verifies your credentials, token, and permissions with Facebook |
| 📨 **Send Test Lead** | Creates a fake test lead to verify the full flow |

***

## ⚙️ Meta App Settings

| Setting | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **App ID** | Your Meta App's unique identifier | `123456789012345` |
| **App Secret** | Your Meta App's secret key | `abc123...` (click 👁️ to show) |

> 🔒 The App Secret is hidden by default. Click the eye icon to reveal it.

After making changes, click **"Save Settings"** 💾

***

## 🔗 Webhook Settings

These are **read-only** values generated by the module:

| Setting | What It Is |
| --- | --- |
| **Webhook Callback URL** | The URL Facebook sends lead data to |
| **Verify Token** | The secret token used during webhook verification |

Click the 📋 **Copy** button to copy each value.

> 💡 **These values never change** unless you reinstall the module. Once configured in Facebook, you don't need to touch them again.

***

## 👤 Lead Settings

Configure how new leads are handled in Perfex CRM:

| Setting | What It Does | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Default Assigned Staff** | Who gets assigned to new leads | Pick your sales person |
| **Default Source** | Lead source tag | Create a "Facebook" or "Meta Leads" source |
| **Default Status** | Initial status for new leads | Usually "New" or "Not Contacted" |

### Options

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ☑️ **Enable duplicate detection** | Off | Prevents importing the same lead twice (based on email) |
| ☑️ **Send email notifications** | On | Sends an email to the assigned staff when a new lead arrives |

> 💡 **Recommended:** Enable duplicate detection if you run campaigns with frequent leads. This prevents the same person submitting twice from creating duplicate entries.

***

## 📄 Connected Pages

At the bottom of the settings page, you'll see your connected Facebook Pages:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Page Name** | Your Facebook Page's name |
| **Status** | 🟢 Monitoring or ⚪ Not Monitoring |
| **Leads Received** | Total leads received from this Page |
| **Action** | Subscribe/Unsubscribe button |

### Managing Pages

| **Add Pages** | Click "Connect with Facebook" |
| **Subscribe** | Click green "Subscribe" button |
| **Unsubscribe** | Click red "Stop Monitoring" button |
| **Refresh** | Click "Connect with Facebook" again |
