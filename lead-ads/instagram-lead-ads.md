# 📸 Instagram Lead Ads

**Great news — Instagram Lead Ads work automatically with this module!** No extra setup, no extra configuration. Same webhook, same data, same CRM. 🎉

***

## 🤔 How Is This Possible?

Instagram is owned by Meta (Facebook's parent company). Behind the scenes, everything goes through the same system:

```
Facebook Lead Ad  ──┐
                    ├──► Same Page Webhook ──► Same Module ──► Same CRM
Instagram Lead Ad ──┘
```

When you subscribed your Facebook Page to receive leads, you automatically covered Instagram too — because Instagram Lead Ads are connected through Facebook Pages.

## 📋 Requirements for Instagram Lead Ads

To run Lead Ads on Instagram, you need:

| Requirement | How to Get It |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ Facebook Page | You already have this |
| ✅ Instagram Business Account | Convert your Instagram to Business (free) |
| ✅ Page & Instagram linked | Connect them in Page settings |
| ✅ Module setup complete | You already did this for Facebook |

### Link Instagram to Your Facebook Page

If not already linked:

1. Go to your **Facebook Page**
2. Click **Settings** (⚙️)
3. Click **Linked Accounts** or **Instagram**
4. Click **Connect Account**
5. Log in with your Instagram credentials

## 🎯 Creating Instagram Lead Ads

The process is **exactly the same** as Facebook Lead Ads! You create them in **Facebook Ads Manager**:

1. Go to [Ads Manager](https://business.facebook.com/adsmanager)
2. Create campaign → Objective: **Leads**
3. In the **Ad Set**, under **Placements:**
   - Select **"Advantage+ Placements"** (includes Instagram automatically)
   - OR manually select **Instagram** placements:
     - ✅ Instagram Feed
     - ✅ Instagram Stories
     - ✅ Instagram Reels
     - ✅ Instagram Explore
4. Create your ad and Lead Form
5. Publish! 🚀

> 💡 **Tip:** If you select "Advantage+ Placements", Facebook will automatically show your ad on both Facebook AND Instagram, optimizing for the best results.

## 📱 Instagram-Specific Tips

### Ad Creative for Instagram

| Tip | Why |
| --- | --- |
| 📐 Use **square (1:1)** or **vertical (4:5)** images | Fits Instagram feed better |
| 🎬 Video performs better | Instagram users love video content |
| 📖 Stories: Use **9:16 vertical** format | Full-screen experience |
| ✨ Keep text minimal on images | Instagram is visual-first |
| #️⃣ Skip hashtags in Lead Ads | Not needed for paid ads |

### Form Best Practices for Instagram

| Tip | Why |
| --- | --- |
| 📱 Keep forms extra short | Instagram users are mobile-only |
| 3️⃣ 3 fields maximum | Name + Email + Phone is plenty |
| ⚡ Use auto-fill fields | Mobile typing is slow |
| 🎨 Match your Instagram aesthetic | Consistency builds trust |

## 🔄 How Leads Flow

The flow is identical for both platforms:

### Facebook Lead:
```
Facebook Feed → User taps ad → Lead Form → Submit → Webhook → Perfex CRM ✅
```

### Instagram Lead:
```
Instagram Feed → User taps ad → Lead Form → Submit → Webhook → Perfex CRM ✅
```

**Same webhook. Same module. Same lead format. Same CRM destination.** 🎯

## 📊 Identifying Instagram vs Facebook Leads

Want to know which platform a lead came from? You can check this in:

### Facebook Ads Manager
- The **Breakdown** menu → **Platform** shows leads per platform

### In Perfex CRM
- Lead Ads from both platforms use the same source (e.g., "Meta Leads")
- If you need to distinguish, create two campaigns (one Facebook-only, one Instagram-only) with different source tags
