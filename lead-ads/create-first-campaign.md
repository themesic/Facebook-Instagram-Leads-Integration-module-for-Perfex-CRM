# 🎯 Create Your First Campaign

Let's create your first Lead Ad campaign! This happens in **Facebook Ads Manager** — completely separate from your Perfex CRM. 📢

***

## 🔗 Open Facebook Ads Manager

1. Go to: 👉 [**https://business.facebook.com/adsmanager**](https://business.facebook.com/adsmanager)
2. Log in with your Facebook account
3. Make sure you're in the right **Ad Account** (check the top-left dropdown)

> 💡 If you've never used Ads Manager, Facebook will guide you through creating an Ad Account. You'll need to add a payment method.

***

## 1️⃣ Create a New Campaign

1. Click **"+ Create"** (big green button, top left)
2. Choose the campaign objective: **"Leads"** 🎯

> ⚠️ **You MUST select "Leads"** as the objective! Other objectives (Traffic, Engagement, etc.) don't create Lead Forms.

3. Give your campaign a name (e.g., "My First Lead Campaign")
4. Click **"Continue"**

***

## 2️⃣ Set Up the Ad Set

The Ad Set is where you configure **who sees your ad** and **how much you spend**.

### Budget 💰

| Option | Description | Good For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Daily Budget** | Spend up to $X per day | Testing ($5-10/day) |
| **Lifetime Budget** | Spend $X total over the campaign duration | Fixed budgets |

> 💡 **For testing:** Start with $5-10/day. You can always increase later.

### Audience 👥

Choose who sees your ad:

| Setting | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Location** | Where your audience lives | United States, United Kingdom |
| **Age** | Age range | 25-55 |
| **Gender** | All, Men, or Women | All |
| **Interests** | What they're interested in | "Small business", "Real estate" |

> 💡 **Start broad** and let Facebook's algorithm find the best audience. You can narrow down later based on results.

### Placements 📱

- **Recommended:** Select **"Advantage+ Placements"** (automatic)
- Facebook will show your ad where it performs best (Facebook feed, Instagram feed, Stories, etc.)

### Select Your Facebook Page ⚠️

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure you select the **same Facebook Page** that you subscribed in the module!

> ⚠️ If you select a different Page than the one monitored in your module, leads won't sync! Double-check this matches.

## 3️⃣ Create the Ad

### Ad Creative (What People See)

| Element | Description | Tips |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Image/Video** | Your ad's visual | Use eye-catching images. 1080x1080 works well |
| **Primary Text** | Main ad copy | Keep it short. Focus on the benefit |
| **Headline** | Bold text under the image | "Get Your Free Quote Today" |
| **Description** | Additional text | Optional |
| **Call to Action** | Button text | "Sign Up", "Get Quote", "Learn More" |

### Example Ad Copy:

```
🏠 Looking for a free home valuation?

Get an accurate estimate of your property value 
in just 2 minutes. No obligation, 100% free!

📍 Available in [Your City]

Headline: Free Home Valuation
CTA: [Get Quote]
```

***

## 4️⃣ Create the Lead Form (Instant Form) 📝

This is the most important part! The Lead Form is what users fill out.

### Create a New Form

1. In the Ad section, scroll to **"Instant Form"**
2. Click **"Create Form"**

### Form Type

| Type | Description | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **More Volume** | Simple, fast form | Maximum leads |
| **Higher Intent** | Adds a review step before submit | Quality leads |

> 💡 **Start with "More Volume"** to test, then switch to "Higher Intent" if you're getting too many low-quality leads.

### Form Fields

1. Click **"Add Questions"**
2. Add the fields you want to collect:

| Field | Type | Auto-filled? | Maps to Perfex |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Full Name | Standard | ✅ Yes | Lead Name |
| Email | Standard | ✅ Yes | Email |
| Phone Number | Standard | ✅ Yes | Phone |
| Company Name | Standard | ✅ Yes | Company |
| City | Standard | ✅ Yes | City |
| Custom Question | Custom | ❌ No | Field Mapping needed |

> 💡 **Keep it short!** 3-5 fields is ideal. Every extra field reduces conversions. Name + Email + Phone is usually enough.

### Intro Section (Optional)

Add a brief intro explaining what the user gets:

```
📋 Fill out this quick form and we'll get back to you within 24 hours!
```

### Privacy Policy

⚠️ **Required!** Facebook requires a privacy policy link.

- Enter your website's privacy policy URL
- Example: `https://yourwebsite.com/privacy-policy`

> 💡 **Don't have a privacy policy?** You can generate one for free at [privacypolicygenerator.info](https://www.privacypolicygenerator.info/) or [termly.io](https://termly.io/products/privacy-policy-generator/).

### Thank You Screen

Customize what users see after submitting:

| Field | Example |
| --- | --- |
| **Headline** | "Thank you!" |
| **Description** | "We'll contact you within 24 hours." |
| **Button** | "Visit Website" → your website URL |

***

## 5️⃣ Review and Publish 🚀

1. Click **"Publish"** (or **"Review"** first)
2. Facebook will review your ad (usually takes minutes to a few hours)
3. Once approved, your ad starts running!

***

## ✅ What Happens Next?

```
Your ad is live on Facebook/Instagram
         ↓
Someone sees your ad and fills out the form
         ↓
⚡ Within SECONDS:
         ↓

## 💡 Tips for Better Results

| Tip | Why |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ Use a clear value proposition | "Get a free quote" beats "Contact us" |
| ✅ Keep the form short (3-5 fields) | Fewer fields = more submissions |
| ✅ Use auto-filled fields | Users submit faster = more leads |
| ✅ Test different ad images | Visual = first impression |
| ✅ Start with a small budget | $5-10/day to test |
| ✅ Follow up fast | Leads go cold quickly — call within 1 hour! |
| ✅ Use "Higher Intent" form type | If lead quality is low |
| ❌ Don't ask for too much info | Users abandon long forms |
| ❌ Don't target too narrow | Let Facebook's algorithm work |
